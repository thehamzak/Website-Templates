						I have three options and I need to randomly pick one (in JavaScript). But not equally random. I want there to be a 10% chance of the first option, 20% chance of the second one, and 70% chance of the third.<br>
						Here are some ways to do that

						This specification does not define what user interface user agents are to use.<br>
						The spec, purposefully, stops short of telling implementations (browsers) how to handle UI.

		It goes on to explain that different languages, cultures, and regions might have good reason to handle numeric inputs differently. So browsers are on their own here, and perhaps this time

Today, we'll look at another security concern for front end developers: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

					</h2>
					<p>
						If you're a WordPress developer that writes HTML/CSS/JS (which is 100% of theme developers and 99% of plugin developers), you need to know the basics of front end security for WordPress. WordPress gives you all the tools you need to make your theme or plugin secure. You just need to know how and when to use each tool.<br>
For example, one huge resposibility you have as a front-end developer is to <em>prevent unescaped content from being printed to the page</em>

						<a href="https://css-tricks.com/probably-use-initial-scale1/">Probably Use initial-scale=1</a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						If you're doing responsive design, you're using viewport <code>&lt;meta /&gt;</code> tags. These tell the browser what width it should render the viewport at. If you don't use this tag, it will render at the device's default, which almost certainly isn't what you want. But even if you are using viewport <code>&lt;meta /&gt;</code>, there are subtle differences in the value you put in it.<br>
						I just wanna focus on one little difference here.

						<p>Imagine a scenario where you need to split a layout in half. Content on the left and content on the right. Basically two equal height columns are needed inside of a container. Each side takes up exactly half of the container, creating a distinct break between one. Like many things in CSS,

					</h2>
					<p>
						Step one is caring about the performance of your websites. Step two is doing things to make it better. Step three is staying on top of performance for the long haul.<br>
						That means not just poking at trying to improve your web performance a few times a year, but making it a part of your active development and trying to prevent regressions. Certainly something that gets harder the more actively developed your site is.

Of course there is far too much about SVG to cover in just one talk, so it's mostly me trying to convince you that SVG is very cool, where to get it, how to use it, and that kind of thing. Also a whole part about using SVG as an icon system and how that
